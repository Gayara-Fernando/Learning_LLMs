    "We first need to setup an account at https://openai.com/. Once you have the account, you need an OpenAI access token (A secret key) to access the LLMs by OpenAI. To set up an access toke, use the link here: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys. You need to copy and paste this link at a safe location so that you can use it when you call these LLMs. And since these models are not open-sourced, we also need to set up a payment method inorder to use them. The charge on a per-token basis. The payment method can be set up using the link at https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview and going to add a payment method. The good thing is, you can set up a hard and a soft limit for the amount you want to spend on a monthly basis. The limits can be set here: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits. Let's run through a few examples Shaw use in his demo. "
